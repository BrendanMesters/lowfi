# lowfi

lowfi is a tiny rust app that serves a single purpose: play lofi.
It'll do this as simply as it can: no albums, no ads, just lofi.

## Why?

I really hate modern music platforms, and I wanted a small, "suckless"
app that would literally just play lofi without video so I could use it
whenever.
